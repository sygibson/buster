Name: debian-mirror-directory
Description: Sets the Debian Mirror Directory path to use.
Documentation: |
  Apparently with Debian Buster (10.0.0) and newer, the network
  preseed file now requires the Mirror to be set, along with the
  mirror directory path.  This Param allows the operator to specify
  which mirror directory path part to use.

  If no value is set, the default of ``/debian``
  will be used.
