Name: debian-mirror-protocol
Description: Sets the Debian Mirror Protocol to use.
Documentation: |
  Apparently with Debian Buster (10.0.0) and newer, the network
  preseed file now requires the Mirror info to be set, along with the
  mirror protocol to use.  This Param allows the operator to specify
  which protocol to use.

  If no value is set, the default of ``https`` will be used.
